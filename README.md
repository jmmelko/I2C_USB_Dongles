# I2C_USB_Dongles
Python script to log and display data fom I2C sensors connected by a microprocessor USB Dongle

# Origin

Adapted from ullix's code on sourceforge, with permission: https://sourceforge.net/projects/i2cpytools/

The original code is no longer updated by Ullix, in favor of his newer programm GeigerLog that has a GUI.

The current repo is simpler than GeigerTools and more adapated to command line usage. Also, I make it available to external contributors by sharing in on Github.

The goal is to make it more Pythonic (especially more object-oriented) to make code maintenance and addition of other sensors and dongles easier.
